- HTML5 semantic tags seemed to be mainly organizational tools that help divy up a webpage into its main components, and they also help provide accessibility to people with disabilities. So far it seems like the nav and section tags are most useful. I picked the nav tag because it seems to provide unique functionality whereas many of the other tags seem to be interchangeable. I chose section because it can be used to section off other content for styling purposes.
- To my understanding, the browser reads the html document from top to bottom and first displays the elements that appear nearer the top.
- I love that we can create our own snippets now! I often find myself wishing I could make up my own keyboard shortcuts, and I'm sure I'll make use of this in the future! I also learned that you can right click or ctrl-click a document in sublime and then open it in the browser from there.
- The thing that gave me and my pair the most trouble was figuring out how to switch driver/navigator in such a way that the 2nd driver wasn't copying an entire repo from the 1st driver but instead only copying the necessary file. We ended up just forking and cloning the entire repo after making the 2nd driver a collaborator, but I'd like to learn ways to just copy individual files. I also am curious if there is a way to push a file to a remote repo without having had to pull or clone that entire repo - is there maybe some concept of adding a remote where you can link a local file to a remote repo without having the entire repo on your local machine? I think I will get better at this with time and more exposure to github workflow and also by google'ing around.
