Robot-Elevator Algorithm:
- print to screen "What floor would you like to go to?"
- set desired_floor = response
- convert desired_floor to an integer
- scan current floor number and set it to current_floor
- if desired_floor = current_floor:
	- do nothing
- elsif current_floor < desired_floor:
	- examine the buttons on the wall
	- while there is no button above a given button:
		- press that button
	- when the elevator arrives:
		- enter the elevator
	- scan the buttons in the elevator until you find a button for which that button number = current_floor
	- set move_amount = desired_floor - current_floor
	- move sensor move_amount buttons to the right until:
		- either desired_floor button is reached or there is not another button to the right:
			- if desired_floor button is reached:
				- press that button
			- if there is not another button to the right:
				- move sensor up one row of buttons and to the left until there is no longer another button to the left of the current button
	- when the doors open back up:
		- exit the elevator and do a victory dance

Make-Scrambled-Eggs Algorithm:
- walk to fridge
- examine contents of fridge
- if number_of_eggs >= 3:
	- take 3 eggs out of fridge
	- put pan on stove
	- turn on the associated burner to medium heat
	- find container with at least a certain volume
	- crack eggs on edge of container and add contents to container
	- until contents are homogenous:
		- whip up the contents with a fork
	- find olive oil in cabinet
	- until surface of pan is lightly covered in olive oil:
		- add oil to pan
	- add eggs to pan
	- until eggs are just ever so slightly watery:
		- scramble eggs
	- sprinkle some salt and pepper on scrambled eggs
	- move eggs to a plate
	- do a victory dance
- else:
	- think of something else to eat =(
