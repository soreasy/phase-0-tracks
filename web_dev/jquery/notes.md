### Learning JQuery plan

First 20 minutes: read articles and get a sense of what jQuery is in general and its advantages/disadvantages

2nd 20 minutes: lookup introductory JQuery tutorials that help one get started with using jQuery in its simplest form

3rd and 4th 20 minutes: play around with jQuery as per the above tutorials. might involve creating a simple project to mess with.

--- 5 min break ---

remaining time: continue implementing different simple features with jQuery and look into what sorts of more complex things can be done



Generally, I plan on getting a high-level sense of what jQuery is first, then looking at specific implementations of jQuery and seeing how others use it, then using it myself. This is my plan simply because it feels like the most natural way to go about gaining familiarity with a new concept without trying too much too soon.
